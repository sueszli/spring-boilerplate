cd springBootBoilerplate

# run application

```

<br>

this project contains all boilerplate code for a full stack application with:

- vanilla js (no framework)
- spring boot
  - maven
  - JPA (the JOOQ driver would have been better, but it isn't free for oracle DB)
- h2 database

it has a simple implementation of crud functionality with server sent events.
